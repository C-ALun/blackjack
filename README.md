<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I'm joining a 100 Days of Coding program <a href="https://github.com/C-ALun/blackjack/blob/main/my_project.py">on Udemy</a>. 

Here's why:
* Get used to using Python language 
* Improve coding skills and style by through projects provided
* Record and motivate myself by pushing on GitHub

I would point out my code and prof code to compare them and highlight how I can become better.

## Session of dealing Card
```
MY_PROJECT:

cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

def deal_card():
	return random.choice(cards)

#deal user a starting hand of 2 random card values
for _ in range(2):
  chosen_card = deal_card()
  player_card_list.append(chosen_card)
  player_score += chosen_card
  
#deal computer a starting hand of 2 random card values
for _ in range(2):
  chosen_card = deal_card()
  computer_card_list.append(chosen_card)
  computer_score += chosen_card
```
```
 PROF_PROJECT:
 
 def deal_card():
  """Returns a random card from the deck."""
  cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
  card = random.choice(cards)
  return card
 
 for _ in range(2):
    user_cards.append(deal_card())
    computer_cards.append(deal_card())
```
### Problems
>Problems: **Duplicated** AND deal_card() function not **reusable**.

## Session of calculating score
```
MY_PROJECT

player_turn = True
computer_turn = True
if computer_score == 21 and player_score == 21:
  player_turn = False
  computer_turn = False
elif computer_score == 21 or player_score == 21:
  if computer_score == 21:
    computer_turn = False
  else:
    player_turn == False

if player_score > 21:
  player_card_list.remove(11)
  player_card_list[0] = 1
  player_score -= 10
elif computer_score > 21:
  computer_card_list.remove(11)
  computer_card_list[0] = 1
  computer_score -= 10

if player_score > 21:
  if 11 in player_card_list:
    player_card_list[player_card_list.index(11)] = 1
    player_score -= 10
    
    .
    .
    .
```
```
PROF_PROJECT

def calculate_score(cards):

  if sum(cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
    return 0
  if 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
    cards.remove(11)
    cards.append(1)
  return sum(cards)
```
### Problems
>Problems: **Complex** AND Some codes are similar, could be written in a function and make it reusable and more maintainable.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Deal both user and computer a starting hand of 2 random card values.
- [ ] Detect when computer or user has a blackjack. (Ace + 10 value card).
- [ ] If computer gets blackjack, then the user loses (even if the user also has a blackjack). If the user gets a blackjack, then they win (unless the computer also has a blackjack).
- [ ] Calculate the user's and computer's scores based on their card values.
- [ ] If an ace is drawn, count it as 11. But if the total goes over 21, count the ace as 1 instead.
- [ ] Reveal computer's first card to the user.
- [ ] Game ends immediately when user score goes over 21 or if the user or computer gets a blackjack.
- [ ] Ask the user if they want to get another card.
- [ ] Once the user is done and no longer wants to draw any more cards, let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards unless their score goes over 16.
- [ ] Compare user and computer scores and see if it's a win, loss, or draw.
- [ ] Print out the player's and computer's final hand and their scores at the end of the game.
- [ ] After the game ends, ask the user if they'd like to play again. Clear the console for a fresh start.
- [ ] See the [open issues](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
